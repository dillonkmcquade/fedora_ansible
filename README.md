## My config files

This is for installing programs on a fresh install for Fedora

Edit `programs.txt` to alter the program install list. The defaults are what I want but maybe you want some others.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dillonkmcquade/config-files.git
cd config-files
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
